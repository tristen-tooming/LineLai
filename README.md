# LineLai


1. Look how Pytorch inits nodes
2. Make python Class to init nodes as a machine
3. RNN  as a top level
4. lower level as a production line graph PyTorchGeometric
5. Estimate note from RNN
6. All parameters if GOOD
7. Slow down if bad, how what to slow down
8. If all goes good append to computational graph (as rnn) and make new timestep
9. if goes bad compute new parameters based on previous input or just rollback
